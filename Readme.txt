My video should explain most of it you might need to change the json credentials locations to wherever you have them but I uploaded, Im so sorry this took me a while to record im struggling.

So i just saw to add all of the features that work

So we have that I can run Mapreduce and build an inverted index on every file not combined but I easily could have added that if I saw that was a requirement and that would have been to just make another catagory with the combined files with no problems and index them 
The communication between the java application and GCP is comeplete being able to automate all tasks performed that project calls for this isncludes submitting a job to the cluster, merging, copying and downloading the output files, deleting files that need to be deleted, and this means all of the functionality for communication is good, for the frist java program we have a implementation using gui that works fine there is some console output but it's not neccesary, the butttons explain how long the user should wait for the job to finish. the Docker side of things is where the project went a little awry, with the docker image building but not having a dependency installed called  libXext.so.6: which I was unsure of how to fix more in my video about that, other than that this is what I have for the project.
